A countdown timer script written in Bash that demonstrates the usage of `getopts` and a `while` loop.

## Description

This Bash script implements a countdown timer. It takes command-line arguments to set the timer duration in minutes and seconds using the `getopts` feature. The script then displays the remaining time in seconds, updating every second until the timer reaches zero. At the end of the countdown, it displays a "Times Up!" message.

## Usage

To use the timer script:

1. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `timer.sh` script.
4. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
./timer.sh -m minutes -s seconds
```

Replace `minutes` with the desired number of minutes and `seconds` with the desired number of seconds for the timer.
